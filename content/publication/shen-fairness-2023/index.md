abstract: 'In the assignment problem, a set of items must be allocated to unit-demand
  agents who express ordinal preferences (rankings) over the items. In the assignment
  problem with priorities, agents with higher priority are entitled to their preferred
  goods with respect to lower priority agents. A priority can be naturally represented
  as a ranking and an uncertain priority as a distribution over rankings. For example,
  this models the problem of assigning student applicants to university seats or job
  applicants to job openings when the admitting body is uncertain about the true priority
  over applicants. This uncertainty can express the possibility of bias in the generation
  of the priority ranking. We believe we are the first to explicitly formulate and
  study the assignment problem with uncertain priorities. We introduce two natural
  notions of fairness in this problem: stochastic envy-freeness (SEF) and likelihood
  envy-freeness (LEF). We show that SEF and LEF are incompatible and that LEF is incompatible
  with ordinal efficiency. We describe two algorithms, Cycle Elimination (CE) and
  Unit-Time Eating (UTE) that satisfy ordinal efficiency (a form of ex-ante Pareto
  optimality) and SEF; the well known random serial dictatorship algorithm satisfies
  LEF and the weaker efficiency guarantee of ex-post Pareto optimality. We also show
  that CE satisfies a relaxation of LEF that we term 1-LEF which applies only to certain
  comparisons of priority, while UTE satisfies a version of proportional allocations
  with ranks. We conclude by demonstrating how a mediator can model a problem of school
  admission in the face of bias as an assignment problem with uncertain priority.'
